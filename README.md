# image-classifier
Image classifier code using CNN and python machine learning libraries
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1: Get an image set and split it into training, validaton, and test sets using 'file_parser.py'
Step 2: Train the neural network with 'model_trainer.py'
Step 3: Evaluate model accuracy with 'evaluator.py'
Step 3: Extract embeddings using 'feature_extractor.py'
Step 4: Perform KMeans, TSNE, and visualize results with 'visualize.py'

The image set used in this work is an amalgamation of three open-source image datasets available via Kaggle
Individual datasets are described and linked below:
    - Squirrels: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sheldenshi/squirrel-data
    - Cats: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ma7555/cat-breeds-dataset
    - Dogs: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/moulhanout/stanford-dogs-dataset
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some or all of these image datasets have been modified to compile the image dataset specific to this project.
    - Refactored file paths. 
    - Renamed files
    - Some files and directories were omitted because they contained limited amounts of data
